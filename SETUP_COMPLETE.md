# Unity Timekeeper - Setup Complete

Congratulations! The facial recognition timekeeping system is now set up. Here's a summary of what has been accomplished:

## 1. Database Setup
- Created necessary tables in Supabase:
  - `facial_profiles` - Stores facial recognition data
  - `time_clock_events` - Records clock in/out events
  - `time_segments` - Matches clock in/out pairs
  - `time_daily_summary` - Provides daily summaries

## 2. Application Architecture
- Created an Electron-based desktop application
- Implemented React for the UI with TypeScript
- Set up Supabase client for data storage and retrieval
- Integrated face-api.js for facial recognition

## 3. Key Features
- Facial recognition for staff identification
- Clock in/out functionality
- Support for multiple break types (tea, lunch, other)
- Staff enrollment system

## 4. Project Structure
- Organized codebase according to best practices
- Created TypeScript type definitions for database schema
- Set up proper build and development scripts

## 5. Security Considerations
- Implemented secure IPC communication in Electron
- Set up Row Level Security in Supabase

## Next Steps

1. **Run the application**:
   ```
   cd timekeeper
   npm run electron:dev
   ```

2. **Enroll Staff**:
   - Navigate to the Staff Enrollment page
   - Select a staff member and capture their facial profile

3. **Test the System**:
   - Try clocking in/out with the enrolled staff

4. **Build for Production**:
   - When ready, create a production build with:
   ```
   npm run electron:build
   ```

5. **Further Development**:
   - Add reporting features
   - Implement admin dashboard
   - Add more advanced liveness detection

Congratulations on setting up your facial recognition timekeeping system!
